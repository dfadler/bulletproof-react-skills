# Third-party notice

This plugin's skills are **adapted from**, not copied verbatim out of,
[alan2207/bulletproof-react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react)'s
`docs/*.md` files, licensed MIT by Alan Alickovic. Unlike a hand-vendored copy, the
adaptation is produced by a scripted generator (`generate.js`, agent-config#217) that
reads the pinned commit below, plus an LLM-assisted polish pass (`polish.js`,
agent-config#218) that rewrites the mechanical draft into agent-directed guidance —
both re-run whenever the pin is bumped — see "Updating".

Currently pinned at commit
[`9506629`](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/commit/9506629ed003a561c6627735480cce4994244bb4)
(2026-09-11).

## Review status

All 7 skills have been reviewed against their pinned source doc(s) for
accuracy and quality (agent-config#218): merged multi-source files (only
`state-and-data`) read coherently as one skill, code examples and rewritten
links were checked against source, and frontmatter descriptions were
confirmed to represent their content. A prior pass (fixing CodeRabbit
findings on PR #221) had already corrected every content-accuracy issue this
review turned up independently — a broken `hooks` link inherited from
upstream, two JSX examples whose `//` comments render as literal text
outside `{}`, an inaccurate "Google factors web vitals into indexing" claim,
missing braces in the `jsconfig.json`/`tsconfig.json` snippets, an
overbroad React Server Components styling claim, and an MSW description
that only covered the browser runtime — so this review pass found no
further changes needed.

## Why a generator instead of a manual copy

bulletproof-react has no releases or tags — its `package.json` `version` field is
static and doesn't track commits — so there's no semver signal to pin against or
watch for updates. The devDependency in this plugin's `package.json` pins an exact
commit SHA instead. A hand-adapted copy of prose docs would go stale silently the
same way agent-config#211's hand-vendored skill copy did; re-running the generator
against a bumped SHA is the automated fix for that failure mode.

## Doc-set drift already observed

At scoping time (agent-config#215), `docs/` had 11 files. At this pin (`9506629`),
it has 12: a new `additional-resources.md` appeared (a bare list of external links,
no React-specific guidance — same "too thin to distill" shape as `deployment.md`,
so it's dropped the same way). This is exactly the drift #215 flagged as a risk in
its "drift detection" open question, and it materialized before generation even
started. The generator (agent-config#217) is expected to notice a doc-set shape
change like this on every re-run rather than silently regenerating around it.

## Updating

This is a **manual process today** — there is no scheduled or CI job that checks for
a new upstream commit and opens a re-pin PR automatically. Given bulletproof-react
has no releases to watch, that would mean periodically diffing the pinned SHA
against upstream `master` on some cadence; worth doing eventually, but it's
explicitly future work, not a requirement for this plugin to be useful today.

1. **Find the new commit to pin** (or use a specific one you've already decided on):

   ```bash
   git ls-remote https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react.git HEAD
   ```

2. **Bump the pin** in `package.json`'s `devDependencies`, then reinstall:

   ```
   "bulletproof-react": "git+https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react.git#<new-sha>"
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This respects the local `.npmrc` (`ignore-scripts=true`): bulletproof-react's
   own `package.json` has a `prepare` script that would otherwise try to install
   three example apps' worth of dependencies just to fetch `docs/*.md`.

3. **Re-run the generator** (`npm run generate`, agent-config#217) and read its
   output. It refuses to proceed — rather than silently regenerating around the
   gap — if the doc set no longer matches its mapping (a file added, removed, or
   renamed); in that case, update `generate.js`'s `SKILL_MAP`/`DROPPED` first.

4. **Review the manifest diff** (`.docs-manifest.json`, per-file content hashes) to
   see which source docs actually changed since the last generation.

5. **Run the polish step** (`npm run polish`) to rewrite each changed skill from
   generate.js's mechanical draft into agent-directed guidance, via `claude -p`.
   Skips any skill whose source hasn't changed since it was last polished
   (tracked in `.polish-manifest.json`), so this only spends an API call — and
   only re-rolls wording — on skills the pin bump actually touched.

6. **Review each changed `SKILL.md`** against its source doc(s) anyway — an LLM
   rewrite can still get a technical detail subtly wrong, especially on
   security-sensitive content, so the human pass from the initial generation
   (agent-config#218) still applies on every re-run, not just the first one.

7. **Commit** the updated `SKILL.md` files, `.docs-manifest.json`,
   `.polish-manifest.json`, the new pinned
   SHA/date in this file, and a bumped `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
